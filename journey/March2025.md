# March 2025

## What I focused on
- Getting started with DSA
- Figuring out which language to stick with

## What I actually did
- Practiced DSA using C
- Switched to C++ for better comfort
- Completed C++ basics
- Earned C++ Basic Completion Badge on HackerRank

## Tools / Tech touched
- C
- C++
- HackerRank

## What worked
- Logic building through basic problems
- C++ felt more flexible than C

## What didn’t
- Writing C without shooting myself in the foot
- Overthinking language choice

## Notes to future me
- Language doesn’t matter as much as problem-solving.
