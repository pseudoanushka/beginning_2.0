## Happy Birthday to Me!!⭐⭐
# August 2025

## What I focused on
- Object-oriented programming
- Revisiting older concepts

## What I actually did
- Completed OOPs in Python
- Revised C++ basics
- Explored MERN stack
- React still unfinished (yes, still)

## Tools / Tech touched
- Python
- C++
- MongoDB
- Express
- React (partially)

## What worked
- OOP concepts finally made sense

## What didn’t
- Completing React

## Notes to future me
- Unfinished ≠ useless. You can come back later.
