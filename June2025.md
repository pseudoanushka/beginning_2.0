# June 2025

## What I focused on
- Surviving exams
- Not burning out completely

## What I actually did
- Took a break from DSA
- Had exams almost every day
- Explored vibe coding just for fun

## Tools / Tech touched
- Random editors
- Random ideas

## What worked
- Taking a break without quitting entirely

## What didn’t
- Structured learning (because exams)

## Notes to future me
- Breaks are part of the process, not failure.
